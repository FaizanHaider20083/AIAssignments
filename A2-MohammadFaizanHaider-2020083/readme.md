Here i will drop instructions for running the prolog file. Should come in handy for future references. Also, let's start with the habit of adding a readme.md

Open terminal and cd to the working directory
Type gprolog and the gprolog program starts
type consult('$filename.pl') to consult the respective file
now invoke the knowledge base and the functions of the file as you see fit

To quit gprolog use control+d

Using swi-prolog for this assignment

Open terminal and cd to the working directory
Type swipl and the swi-prolog program starts
type ['$filename.pl'] to consult the respective file
